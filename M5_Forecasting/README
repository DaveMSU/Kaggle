Here is only EDA for my first Kaggle competition.

Very good description of correspond problem you can see in notebook above, but only in Russian :(

For my bad, I wrote all my code in Google Colab and it's depicted not so good as it could be,
so you can see it in my colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1og73jBodSfpmTWW_8xl70UqIENt43QU0?usp=sharing
or in Kaggle notebook:         https://www.kaggle.com/davidmsu/eda-for-russian-beginners-from-russian-beginner
