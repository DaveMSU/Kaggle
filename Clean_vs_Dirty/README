This is my very first Kaggle championship, of course it was 'in class' :)
I took part in it an year ago (~ july 2019 ~).
Nevertheless, I decide to publish it now.


Brief description: 

It was my first step in DL. Actually, I hadn't know anything about ML at all.
I saw that Samsung Research Russia started their own online-course: https://stepik.org/course/50352/syllabus
and they promised to invite the top-10 students for an internship.
So, it started on 01 June and first invitetions was sent on the end of July. So, by this way I was 7-th and was invited
(among the 13,000 course participants and 540 who completed the course).

Nevertheless, Kaggle compition is ongoing and anyone can invite in it, even now.
So, my Kaggle rank in this compitition on 31 July 2019 was 17/600.
For now it is 83/956 (top-9%)
